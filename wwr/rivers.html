<h2>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
<p>
          Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon River. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.
        </p>
<p>
          Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river, while bear and bighorn sheep are also commonly sighted. The river corridor is lined with awe-inspiring ponderosa pines, towering over the sandy beaches in the campsites, providing shelter from sun or rain when needed.
        </p>
<p>
          Let's not forget the rapids! They range from Class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a free-flowing river, the water is higher, faster, and colder in early summer, while late summer brings lower, slower, and warmer conditions. Families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.

<h2>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h2>
<p>
          Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green River flows toward the mighty Colorado River and the sea. High gray stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous.
        </p>

<p>
          This 84-mile trip runs from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River, Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.
        </p>
<p>
          Desolation Canyon is rated Class II/III and is typically done in six days. The canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark due to its uniqueness and rich history.

<h2>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2>
<p>
          This is the granddaddy of all canyons and the granddaddy of all river trips. You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.

<p>
          Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to create one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids but also with side canyons and ancient indigenous ruins accessible only by river.
        </p>
<p>
          The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale, technically rated I - X (1 - 10), to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, most people are familiar with the standard I - V rating scale, so we often reference both.
