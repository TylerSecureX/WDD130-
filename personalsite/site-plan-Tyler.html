    <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
    <p>
        Remember when games were built to last? I do—and I bring them back to life.
         I repair classic video game consoles like NES, Sega, and PlayStation, 
         combining hands-on skill with a love for retro tech.
         My website showcases restorations, tutorials, and satisfied gamers.
         I'm not just fixing hardware — I'm preserving memories.
